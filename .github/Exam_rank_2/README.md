### Exam Details üßê

- The exam has 4 levels, with 1 random question from each level. üìà

- If you fail the exercise, you can retake it as many times as needed within the available time. For example, if you fail the exercise from Level 1 on your first attempt, you can keep attempting it repeatedly until you succeed.
 
- Each **`grademe`** request increases the waiting time before the next attempt.

- **No Norminette** is applied.


### My Personal Approach

      My approach to preparing for this exam is distinct. I prioritize a deep understanding of core concepts and practice a variety of problems to develop a comprehensive grasp of the material. Instead of merely aiming to pass, I adopt a strategy that involves exploring multiple solutions and delving into the underlying principles. This method enhances my ability to tackle questions more efficiently and effectively during the exam.<br><br>
      Rather than progressing through each level sequentially, I categorize the tasks by grouping similar functions and programs together, irrespective of their designated levels. To do so, I practice libft and piscine exercises. This approach facilitates a more focused study of related concepts and skills. The main objective of this method is to identify and track areas for improvement in the logical structure and implementation of the code.

### Exam Strategy üéØ

1Ô∏è‚É£ **First of all, are you comfortable taking the exam?** ü§î

If not, it would be a great idea to attempt it as many times as possible. üîÅ Remember, at **42**, failing an exam doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not good, it‚Äôs simply part of the learning process. üìöüìà Treat each attempt as an opportunity to improve and gain deeper understanding. üí°‚ú®

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Once you feel comfortable, do you fully understand the subject?** üìñüßê

If not, take your time to **read carefully**.üìñüí≠ Since you have a white paper and a pen üìù‚úèÔ∏è, use them to write down anything you don‚Äôt understand. This way, you can ask your peers for clarification and improve your comprehension. üìùüë•


3Ô∏è‚É£ **Once you‚Äôve done this, do you remember the Git commands?** ü§ñüíæ

If not check it [here](https://github.com/DevAwizard/Exams_school/blob/main/.github/Resources/Exam_Login_Guide.md)üìú. It‚Äôs useful to remember the commands in case you need to check the status üîçüìå, view the history of logs, üïíüìä or manage your repository efficiently. üíª‚öôÔ∏è


> [!TIP]
> Also, use this [checklist and questionaire](https://github.com/DevAwizard/Exams_42/blob/main/.github/Resources/Check_list_exam.md) to write down which exercises you failed and passed, and have a record of it. üìã
> 
> If you want to know which exercises appear on the exam, the best approach is to attempt as many as possible
