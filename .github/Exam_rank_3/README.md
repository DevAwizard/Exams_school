### Exam Details 🧐

- The exam consists of 2 random questions: either **`printf`** 🖨️ or **`get_next_line`** 📝.

- If you fail the exercise, you can retake it as many times as needed within the available time.

- Each **`grademe`** will increase the amount of time for the next attempt. ⏳

- **No Norminette** rules are applied.



Here are the two exercises you may be asked to do:

**ft_printf**

This one is pretty simple, you need to implement only a part of the conversion from the original printf: %x, %s and %d. Pretty easy.

**get_next_line**

A while back, this exercise wasn't compile with the -D BUFFER_SIZE flag, so it could be done on three (3) lines of code. But the subject changed, and now you have to build a complete get_next_line.

## My Personal Approach

I start by writing down the exercise and reviewing the relevant subjects (printf or gnl). I then refresh my knowledge on the key concepts needed for each topic. 

- For printf 🖨️, I focus on variadic functions and conversion specifiers. 

- For get_next_line 📝, I concentrate on file handling, buffers, and the static variable. 

This structured review helps me prepare effectively for the exam. For more details, refer to the following [documentation](https://github.com/DevAwizard/Exams_42/tree/main/.github/Exam_rank_3/My_personal_approach)📄.
